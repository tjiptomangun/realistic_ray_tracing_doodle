grad = (y - y0)/(x - x0)
eq 2
y - (-3) = grad2(x - 4)
y + 3 = grad2.x - grad2.4
y = grad2*x - grad2*4 - 3
eq 1
y - (-3) = grad1(x - 0)
y + 3 = grad1.x - 0
y = grad1.x - 3

grad1.x - 3 = grad2*x - grad2*4 - 3

 

-------------------------
known two segment of line with each starting point and each gradiend
find c1 and c2  first

eq.
m1(x11 - x01)  = y11 - y01
m1x11 - m1x01  = y11 - y01
since x01 and y01 is know then the equation can be simplified with
m1x11 + y01 - m1x01 = y11
y01 - m1x01= c1
assume c2 also found
y1 = m1x1 + c1
y2 = m2x2 + c2
if y1 = y2
m1x1 + c1 = m2x2 + c2
m1x1 - m2x2 = c2 - c1
x1(m1 - m2) = c2 - c1
x = (c2 - c1)/(m1 - m2)
